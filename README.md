# UNet Scratch with CityScapes dataset
I implemented UNet with Cityscapes dataset.

### UNet

UNet is the one of the baseline segmentation models. It is created to segment biomedical images. Biomedical images are grayscale images, and they donâ€™t have lots of datasets(Also, small size of images). So, the focus of the Unet is to segment well with less data. Also, the bio image has lots of pattern features, so its goal was the abstract features well. UNet consists of the convolutional neural networks(CNN). And it has a contracting path, expanding path and skip connection.
